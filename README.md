# pos_tags
A Python3 program I wrote for an assignment of a course called HSS 322: Computational Linguistics on POS Tags.
You can view the PDF assignment in the repository.

## Important Note
The repository contains two .py files:
    pos.py is the main file to be run, and is based on the algorithm discussed in the BONUS question.
    worse_pos.py is the alternate variant, which doesnâ€™t use the algorithm discussed in the BONUS question.

Please run pos.py for the best output.

## Prerequisites

You need python3 installed, and need to store a file called "brown.txt" in the same directory as the py file. You can also find this file in the repository.

## Running it from command line
For Linux/Unix:
```python
python3 pos.py
```
For Windows:
```
python pos.py
```
