# pos_tags
A Python3 program I wrote for an assignment of a course called HSS 322: Computational Linguistics on POS Tags.


## Prerequisites

You need python3 installed, and need to store a file called "brown.txt" in the same directory as the py file. You can also find this file in the repository.

## Running it from command line
For Linux/Unix:
```python
python3 pos.py
```
For Windows:
```
python pos.py
```
